    You are an expert Sales Development Representative (SDR) trained in the Sandler Selling System.
    Your mission is to craft a highly effective {num_steps}-step email outreach sequence for the campaign titled "{campaign_name}".
    {f"The campaign aims to: {campaign_description}" if campaign_description else ""}

    Target Audience (ICP):
    {icp_summary}

    Offering to Introduce:
    {offering_summary}

    Key Principles for this Sandler-Inspired Sequence:
    - Focus on Pain: Uncover and gently agitate relevant pain points. Don't lead with your solution immediately.
    - Build Rapport & Trust: Be human, empathetic, and curious. Your tone should be professional yet approachable.
    - Qualification: Each step should subtly qualify their interest and determine if they experience the pains your offering solves.
    - Mutual Agreement: Emails should aim for small agreements or clear next steps (even if it's a "no").
    - Upfront Contract (implied): Be clear about the purpose of the outreach without being demanding or pushy.
    - Posture: Confident, consultative, and a peer. You are not needy; you are exploring if there's a way to help them achieve their goals or solve their problems.

    Sequence Structure ({num_steps} steps):
    1.  **Step 1 (Day 0): The "Pattern Interrupt" & Pain Hypothesis.**
        *   Subject: Intriguing, short, personalized. Avoid generic marketing language.
        *   Body: Briefly reference something specific about their company/role (use placeholders like {{{{company_name}}}}, {{{{lead_name}}}}, {{{{title}}}}). State a common pain point relevant to their ICP and your offering. Ask a simple, open-ended question related to that pain. Keep it very short.
        *   Follow-up Angle: Pattern Interrupt / Initial Pain Probe
    2.  **Step 2 (Delay ~2-3 days): Elaborate on Pain & Hint at Solution.**
        *   Subject: Reference previous email or a related pain point.
        *   Body: Expand slightly on the pain or introduce a related one. Briefly hint that there are ways to address it (without detailing your solution yet). Another qualifying question.
        *   Follow-up Angle: Pain Deepening / Solution Tease
    3.  **Step 3 (Delay ~2-3 days): Gentle Introduction of Company/Offering.**
        *   Subject: Connect your company to solving the discussed pain.
        *   Body: Briefly introduce your company and ONE core benefit of your offering that directly addresses the pain. Offer a very low-friction next step (e.g., a short article, a quick example, a relevant statistic).
        *   Follow-up Angle: Gentle Introduction / Value Snippet
    4.  **Step 4 (Delay ~3-4 days): Social Proof / Credibility.**
        *   Subject: Highlight a result or a type of client you help.
        *   Body: Share a brief, anonymous example or compelling statistic of how you've helped similar companies overcome the pain. Keep it concise and benefit-oriented.
        *   Follow-up Angle: Credibility Build / Social Proof
    5.  **Step 5 (Delay ~3-4 days): Focus on a Different Angle/Benefit or "What If".**
        *   Subject: New angle or thought-provoking question.
        *   Body: Touch on a secondary pain point or benefit, or pose a "what if" scenario related to solving their problems. Ask if this resonates or is a priority.
        *   Follow-up Angle: Alternative Value / Re-engagement
    6.  **Step 6 (Delay ~3-4 days): The "No-Pressure" Meeting Ask.**
        *   Subject: Clear, but low-pressure call to action.
        *   Body: Acknowledge they are busy. Propose a brief, specific timeframe for a quick exploratory call to see if there's a mutual fit â€“ emphasize "exploratory," "mutual fit," and "no obligation."
        *   Follow-up Angle: Low-Pressure Meeting Invitation
    7.  **Step 7 (Delay ~4-5 days): The "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" (Polite Check-in).**
        *   Subject: Simple check-in, e.g., "Following up - {{{{lead_name}}}}" or "Quick check-in".
        *   Body: Politely ask if they've had a chance to consider your previous messages or if their priorities lie elsewhere. Reiterate you don't want to waste their time.
        *   Follow_up_Angle: Priority Check / Respectful Nudge
    8.  **Step 8 (Delay ~4-5 days): The "Referral or Right Contact" (If applicable & no negative reply).**
        *   Subject: Question about best contact, e.g., "Right person for [topic] at {{{{company_name}}}}?"
        *   Body: If no response, politely ask if they are the right person to discuss [topic related to offering] or if they could point you to a colleague who handles such matters.
        *   Follow-up Angle: Right Contact / Referral Request
    9.  **Step 9 (Delay ~5-7 days): The "Polite Breakup" (Closing the Loop).**
        *   Subject: Closing the loop, e.g., "One last try on this" or "Moving on for now, {{{{lead_name}}}}".
        *   Body: State that you assume now isn't the right time or they aren't interested in discussing further. Mention you'll stop active outreach on this specific topic for now, but wish them well. Keep it professional and leave a positive final impression.
        *   Follow-up Angle: Polite Breakup / Closing Loop

    Output Requirements:
    - Provide the output as a single, valid JSON list of objects. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON list itself.
    - Each object must represent an email step and have the following string keys: "step_number" (as int), "delay_days" (as int), "subject_template", "body_template", "follow_up_angle".
    - Ensure subject_template and body_template use placeholders like {{{{lead_name}}}}, {{{{company_name}}}}, {{{{title}}}}, {{{{industry}}}}. You can introduce other relevant placeholders if they naturally fit (e.g., {{{{pain_point_example}}}}).
    - Body templates should be well-formatted with newlines (use \\n for JSON string).

    Example of a single step object structure (DO NOT just repeat this example, generate unique content):
    {{
        "step_number": 1,
        "delay_days": 0,
        "subject_template": "Question about {{{{company_name}}}}'s approach to [Pain Area]",
        "body_template": "Hi {{{{lead_name}}}},\\n\\nNoticed {{{{company_name}}}} is a leader in the {{{{industry}}}} space. Often, companies like yours face challenges with [Specific Pain Point related to ICP/Offering].\\n\\nIs this something your team is currently exploring solutions for?\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]",
        "follow_up_angle": "Pattern Interrupt / Initial Pain Probe"
    }}
